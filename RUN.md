## Visualization the saved tensorboard event file:

You can visualize your runs using tensorboard:
```
python -m tensorboard.main --logdir data
```

You will see scalar summaries as well as videos of your trained policies (in the 'images' tab).

You can choose to visualize specific runs with a comma-separated list:
```
python -m tensorboard.main --logdir data/run1,data/run2,data/run3...
```
